### Inspiring Feature
The inspiring feature of an application is you can send multiple emails using 'MultiSend' button

Now, Suppose, I want to send mail to 100 of my contacts say "Good Morning" and i want to send this email 50 times to each one of the 100 contacts.All i need to do is just add "Good Morning" in the message field and it will load your receivers.txt file from current directory or provide it once and click MultiSend and type 50 here.

Done!!!

Thanks for using it!
